The Reconciliation Cockpit is a financial interface designed to reconcile Bank Transactions with Orders. It features a split-screen "cockpit" layout optimized for rapid manual and automated matching.
1. Header & Global Actions

The top bar acts as the command center for the application.

    System Status: Displays the title "Reconciliation Cockpit" along with live counters for "Unmatched Bank" and "Unmatched Orders".
    Primary Actions:
        UPLOAD BANK FILE: Initiates the manual upload of bank statements.
        FETCH ORDERS FROM API: Fetches fresh order data. It includes a 10-minute cooldown timer (displayed as M:SS) to prevent API rate limiting.
        AUTOMATE SUGGESTIONS: Manually triggers the matching engine to find potential matches.
        RECONCILED: A button to go to a new view showing all the reconciled records.
    View Controls:
        Matched Toggle: A switch to show/hide the "Matched" panel, that shows the current batch of records that are being matched.
        

2. The Workspace (Split View)

The interface is vertically divided into two main panels:

    Left Panel: Bank Transactions
        Search & Filter: Real-time filtering by Payee, Amount, or Reference.
        Sorting: Sortable columns for Date, Reference, Payee, and Amount.
        Data Display: Rows show Date, Reference Badge (e.g., "REF-001"), Payee Name, and Amount.
        Footer: Summarizes visible item count and total value.
    Right Panel: Orders
        Search & Filter: Real-time filtering by Client, Amount, Reference, or Order Number.
        Sorting: Sortable columns for Date, Reference, Client, Order Number, and Amount.
        Data Display: Rows show Date, Reference Badge, Order ID (7-digit Big Int, e.g., "1234567"), Client Name, and Amount.
        Footer: Summarizes visible item count and total value.

3. Smart Matching Engine

The core workflow involves linking items from the left panel to the right.

    Selection & Matching:
        Users select items from both lists by clicking.
        Dynamic Action Bar: A floating header bar appears upon selection, showing the Difference between selected totals.
        Perfect Match: If the difference is effectively zero (< 0.01), the difference text turns green, and the "Match" button glows.
        Match Execution: A "Match [X] to [Y]" button commits the link.
        Shortcuts: Pressing "M" triggers the match action.
    Match Quality Indicators: When items are selected, the system displays comparison stats:
        R: Reference Match (Y/N)
        N: Name Similarity (0-100%)
        D: Date Difference (+/- Days)
        A: Amount Difference

4. Suggested Matches

A collapsible "Suggested Matches" panel appears at the top when the matching engine finds high-confidence links.

    Visual Comparison: Shows the Bank Transaction and proposed Order side-by-side, connected by a visual line.
    Controls: Explicit "Approve" (Checkmark) and "Reject" (X) buttons for each suggestion.
    Bulk Action: An "Approve All" button processes all suggestions at once.

5. Matched History

Accessible via the "Matched" toggle.

    History Panel: Displays a list of the current reconciled groups, from the current batch.
    Audit Trail: Shows exactly which bank transactions matched which orders.
    Unmatch: Allows users to break a match if needed, returning items to the unmatched pools.
    Reconcile Button: A specialized "RECONCILE" button appears in this panel header when matches exist, to fully reconcile this batch.

Now, let's define the database. Create the database and nothing else. Don't add any logic. 

The database has two main tables:
bank_transactions and orders

the table bank_transactions has the following columns:
1. transaction_hash (Primary Key): String/Text. A unique SHA256 hash.
2. payer_sender: String/Text. The name of the person/entity sending money.
3. transaction_date: Date. The date of the transfer.
4. credit_amount: Decimal/Float. The amount received.
5. description: String/Text. The cleaned payment details/comments.
6. extracted_reference: String/Text. The business code (e.g., AB123456) parsed from the description.
7. match_reference_flag: Integer/Boolean. 1 if the extracted reference matches an Order exactly, 0 otherwise.
8. match_name_score: Float. A similarity score (0-100) comparing 'payer_sender' to the Order's customer name.
9. diff_days: Integer. The difference in days between 'transaction_date' and the Order date.
10. diff_amount: Decimal/Float. The difference between 'credit_amount' and the Order total.
11. reconciliation_status: String. This field is a changeable field that could have the following values: suggested_match (which makes reference when a transaction has a suggested match), temporarily_matched (when the user approves the suggested match or matches it manually), reconciled (when it's fully reconciled)
12. order_id n to 1 relationship with the orders. 
13. imported_at: timestamp when the record is imported
14. reconciled_at: timestamp when the record is fully reconciled. 

the table orders should have the following columns: 
1. order_id (Primary Key): Integer. The unique ID of the order (e.g., 847311).
2. order_bank_reference: String/Text. The reference code (e.g., "GA908699"). *Note: This is the field that matches the 'extracted_reference' in the bank_transaction table.*
3. amount: Decimal/Float. The net amount to be sent (e.g., 50.00).
4. fee: Decimal/Float. The service fee (e.g., 3.95).
5. amount_total_fee: Decimal/Float. The total amount the customer must pay (e.g., 53.95). *Note: This is the value that usually matches 'credit_amount' in the bank statement.* This is the amount we care about, the one we'll show in the UI.
6. order_timestamp: DateTime. The exact time the order was placed (ISO format).
7. order_date: Date. The date component.
8. customer_name: String/Text. Full name (e.g., "Gabriela Alejandra..."). 
9.match_reference_flag: Integer/Boolean. 1 if the reference matches a Bank Transaction exactly, 0 otherwise.
10. match_name_score: Float. A similarity score (0-100) comparing the customer's name to the 'payer_sender' on the bank transactions.
11. diff_days: Integer. The difference in days between order_date and the 'transaction_date' in the Transaction info.
12. diff_amount: Decimal/Float. The difference between 'credit_amount' and the Order total.
13. reconciliation_status: String. This field is a changeable field that could have the following values: suggested_match (which makes reference when a transaction has a suggested match), temporarily_matched (when the user approves the suggested match or matches it manually), reconciled (when it's fully reconciled)
14. fetched_at: timestamp when the record is fetched from the API. 
15. reconciled_at: timestamp when the order is fully reconciled. 
16. transaction_ids: 1 to n relationship link pointing to transactions' table. 

please make sure the data types are appropriate for a standard SQL environment (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
